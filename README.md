# StreamElements_CustomWidgets
Custom Widgets made for StreamElements

Each Widgets here was used or will be used on my streams.

The First Custom Widget will be the Follower Objectives (and will be replicated for Subscriber, Tipper and Bits with a little twist to show how much they have given).
Inspired by Helldivers2's XP Bar, this will be constituted with :
(- Background Color with opacity ?)
(- Images for the types of contribution ?) 
- Username of Last Person
- Title
- Level of the Objective
- Actual Follower / Follower Goal
- Progress Bar
